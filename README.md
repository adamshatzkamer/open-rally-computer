# Open Rally Computer

An open source tripmaster for navigation rallies

![Open Rally Computer](img/orc.png?raw=true "Open Rally Computer")

## Description

The Open Rally Computer (previously known as [Baja Pro](https://baja.matto.io/)) is a complete tripmaster for navigation rallies.

Some of its features are:

- Based on GPS technology
- Adjustable partial distance odometer
- Total distance odometer
- Speedometer
- Average speed
- Max speed
- Trip time
- Compass (CAP heading)
- Multiple languages and unit systems
- Firmware updates over-the-air

The main goal of this project is to achieve a widely used open-source device that can be improved over time by ourselves, the pilots behind the roadbook.

## Schematics and PCB

You can find all the necessary information for fabricating your own copy of the Open Rally Computer PCB in the [pcb](docs/pcb) and [schematics](docs/schematics) folders of this repository.

> **HELP NEEDED**: My knowledge in electronics is self-taught, so I'm sure there are quite a few improvements to be done in this department. If you know electronics and spot something that can be improved, please let me know by opening an issue.

- Previous models of this device have been fabricated at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) with great results and very good prices.
- The system I used to create the PCB was [EasyEDA](https://easyeda.com/). You can find files for the schematics and the PCB in their relative folders. There are also versions for Altium Designer.

> **HELP NEEDED**: I'd like to port these schematics and PCB to KiCad, so we continue with the open source spirit :)
>
> If you know your way around KiCad, I'd really appreciate some help porting this board.

The bill of materials is located in a CSV file in the [bom](docs/pcb/bom) folder. If you find a missing component, please report it by opening an issue.

## User manual

You can find a PDF version of the User Manual in the [manual](docs/manual) folder.

> **HELP NEEDED**: The user manual is currently only in Spanish and it still has a lot of Baja Pro branding that has to be changed to "Open Rally Computer". I'd really appreciate some help transcribing it to Markdown and translating it into other languages, being english the top priority right now.

## Getting Started

These instructions will allow you to compile the project in you local computer. In order to run it you will need an actual device.

### Prerequisites

This project has been developed using VSCode with the PlatformIO plugin, which is is the recommended setup.

- Install [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install the [PlatformIO plugin](https://platformio.org/install/ide?install=vscode)
- Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mattogodoy/open-rally-computer.git
```

### Building

To build this project you can open the directory of the repository you just downloaded in VSCode.

Once open, go to the sidebar at the left, PlatformIO -> esp32dev -> General -> Build

The required libraries are already bundled in the `lib` directory of this repo. PlatformIO will automatically try to use them.
If for some reason you are getting compilation errors because of missing libraries, you can always install them manually going to PlatformIO -> PIO Home -> Libraries.

You can find the list of necessary libraries in the file [platformio.ini](platformio.ini).

## Flashing into device

Once the project compiles correctly in your computer, you are ready to flash it into the rally computer.

1. Connect your ESP32 (DevKit or programmer) to your computer via USB.
2. Go to PlatformIO -> esp32dev -> General -> Upload
3. PlatformIO should automatically detect the serial port where your ESP32 is connected, buld the project and flash it for you.
